# Thermo-Mechanical-Reliability-Analysis-of-Flip-Chip-BGA-Packaging
Built a 3D flip-chip BGA model in ANSYS to study solder-joint reliability under JEDEC thermal cycling. Evaluated the impact of underfill CTE and modulus on warpage, stress, and shear strain, identifying material property ranges that significantly improve solder fatigue life.
